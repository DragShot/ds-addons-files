# Need for Madness Multiplayer: DS-addons pack!

A community client for the game **Need for Madness Multiplayer**, the latest of the old cherished saga of crazy 3D cartoony cars racing, flying and crashing against each other at top speed.

Ever since the game stopped receiving updates in 2015, this client has continued to receive new features, bug fixes and other quality of life improvements over the years. It is currently being maintained by **DragShot** and **Phyrexian**, who take ideas and requests from the community and eventually make them reality during their free time. New HUD looks, game modes, in-game modifiers and effects, upgrades to the custom user content and many other goodies have been incorporated and will continue to come!

> This repository exists as a content server for updates, but since Google decided to index it, it might as well start to be used for other things as well. Perhaps a Wiki could be filled with resources about the game or something like that in the future.
